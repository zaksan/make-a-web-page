          <p>Daaaaamn. I should haveepaid more attention to where to get codepen. <br> 
            Quizzes don't work on the iphone 5s. That's <b>not <em>exceptionally</em> convenient</b>.
            Easy peasy so far. HTML tags and elements and everything is just review of <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> stuff... although of none of that ever became muscle memory and this is the perfect way to get reminded of it. All of a sudden I'm all excited about this stuff again.

          The "tree-like structure" of HTML

          <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can 
          draw this relationship like a family tree. Your mother... yeah, that's right. Your mother! 

          <br>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
          nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
          boxes, and so on...

          <p>
            When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
            of changing indentations going up and down the left side
            of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
            deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

              Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons. If you don't avoid repetition, you're going to copy and paste yourself into hours of "why doesn't this work". Then, when you go to make changes, you're going to go through the same hell.

              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
